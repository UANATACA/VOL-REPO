# What it is

<div style="text-align: justify">
The high-performance solution for electronic signature Validation and Verification service, providing detailed information of the result.
<br></br>
Uanataca VOL API is a turnkey system that can be easily integrated with any business application or web thanks to its high-level web API based on the http RESTful paradigm.
</div>

# How it works

The solution is given with VOL Optimizer that is a server system exposing http RESTful APIs by means of which, business applications are enabled to require the electronic signature validation of documents.

VOL Optimizer performs the most computationally expensive workload of the validation and verification process, thus reducing the data traffic on the local network. The signed documents to be validated are processed in the customer business layer and are not send to Uanataca Services.

The system performs the validation and verification on all the signatures contained in a document, including timestamps. The validation consists on:

- Verify that the certificate is issued by a Trusted Service Provider (TSP).
- Verify that the certificate was valid at the time of signing. It means that the certificate was not expired or revoked at that moment.
- Verify the integrity of the document, verifying that no changes were done to the document after the signature.

The verification of the digital certificate is carried out through OCSP and CRL queries to the corresponding TSP issuer.

# Configuration

VOL Optimizer is supplied as a **Docker** image.


## Hardware requirements


**CPU:** modern multicore (minimum 4 core)

**RAM:** 8GB

**HDD:** 200 GB


## VOL Optimizer on Docker


This configuration requires a server with a Linux CentOS operating system.

</br>


> STEP 1: Install Docker and Docker-Compose.

*Docker*

Run the following commands in this order.

	sudo yum update -y
	yum install -y yum-utils device-mapper-persistent-data lvm2
	yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
	sudo yum install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
	sudo systemctl start docker



*Docker-Compose*

Run the following commands in this order.


	sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.28.5/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
	chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose


Run command **docker-compose version** to check the installation. The outcome should show this information:


![img](https://github.com/UANATACA/VOL-REPO/raw/main/img/vol-docker1.png) 

</br>

> STEP 2: Extract and copy VOL Optimizer zip content to the server.

Extract all `vol_optimizer_docker.zip` content in a local folder.

Move VOL Optimizer folder to the path **/opt** in the server.

The outcome should look like this:

![img](https://github.com/UANATACA/VOL-REPO/raw/main/img/vol-docker2.png)

</br>


> STEP 3: Load One-Shot Docker images.

Run the following commands:

	cd /opt/vol_optimizer
	docker image load -i vol-api.tar.gz
	docker image load -i vol-gui.tar.gz
	docker image load -i vol-web.tar.gz

Remove image files:

	rm -rf /opt/vol_optimizer/*.gz

</br>

> STEP 4: Launch the service.

Run this command:

	docker-compose up -d

</br>

> STEP 5: Service settings.

See <a href="#section/Configuration/Service-settings">service settings</a> configuration section.

</br>


## Service settings

<div style="text-align: justify">
Uanataca VOL exposes a custom website to validate documents. The website requires an SSL certificate and Billing credentials. Both requirements are also needed to use the service through API.
</div>


**Requirements:**

- Billing credentials for Uanataca production environment.
- SSL Certificate (.cer) and key (.key) files.


> STEP 1: SSL Certificate.

The SSL certificates are required to expose the validation web. If the web is not exposed, the SSL certificate demo files provided in the `vol_optimizer_docker.zip` can be used.

Consider the following server path:

	/home/bit4id/vol-volumes/vol-web-storage/

Please copy SSL certificate files here. If you don't have your own certificate, the provided demo certificate can be used. They are located at /opt/vol_optimizer/demo_SSL_certificate in the server.

	cd /opt/vol_optimizer/demo_SSL_certificate/
	cp server.cer server.key /home/bit4id/vol-volumes/vol-web-storage/

</br>

> STEP 2: Billing credentials.

Copy `vol-gui-passwd.tar` file to the path **/home/bit4id/** in the server.
Extract the content:

	cd /home/bit4id/
	tar -xvf vol-gui-passwd.tar.gz

Run the script to insert your client Billing credentials (username and password):

	./passwd
	cd /home/bit4id/vol-gui-passwd/bin
  
</br>

> STEP 3: Launch the service.

Run the following commands:

	cd /opt/vol_optimizer/
	systemctl start docker
	docker-compose start

Check service status:

	docker-compose ps

	Name               Command               State                Ports
	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	api     /opt/bit4id/api/bin/uwsgi  ...   Up
	docs    /docker-entrypoint.sh sh / ...   Up      80/tcp, 8080/tcp
	gui     /opt/bit4id/gui/bin/uwsgi  ...   Up
	redis   docker-entrypoint.sh redis ...   Up      6379/tcp
	web     /opt/bit4id/nginx/entry_po ...   Up      0.0.0.0:443->443/tcp,:::443->44
    	                                             3/tcp, 0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp,:::80
                                                 	->80/tcp

All services must be UP.

</br>

> STEP 4: Contact Uanataca support team.

The last step before document validation requires additional settings that may vary for each client server. Please contact our support team for assistance.   

# Endpoint URLs

The URL exposing the API is composed as follows:

	{host}/api/{resource}/

> host

The {host} is the IP or domain from the VOL Optimizer.
<br>

> resource

It is the name of the resource of our interest.

Each resource can also have path parameters and sub-resources that are defined in the <a href="#APIReference">API Reference</a> below.
<br>

This is an example of endpoint:

	https://vol.uanataca.com/api/documents/


# Authentication

VOL service requires authentication with the provided **Billing credentials**.
 
Each endpoint requires an authentication header before performing the requested action.
The header must containt the type (Basic) and a Base64 string that contains the Billing credentials in the format **username:password** in Base64.

	Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=

This is an example with cURL:

	1 | curl -H "Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=" -X GET https://vol.uanataca.com/api/documents/06618cc5d920cb09/content
